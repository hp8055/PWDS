    "# Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability of a program to utilize multiple CPU cores or processors to execute tasks concurrently. It involves running multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory space, allowing them to perform computations independently of each other.\n",

This can lead to significant performance improvements, as it enables parallel processing and efficient utilization of available computational resources.\n",

By leveraging multiple CPU cores, multiprocessing allows programs to perform tasks faster and more efficiently, ultimately reducing the overall execution time.\n",
